# ASH Admin Service
The ASH admin service provides an interface to inspect and manipulate the shared Redis state on which any instances of ASH Mock Service will depend. In order to support consistency across test suites, it also implements DynamoDB-based storage for test descriptions and test suites. The specific purpose of this service is to provide the human-facing interface to the operation of ASH. If a new feature doesn't support human interaction, please consider making a different ASH service or modifying ASH Mock instead. If code in this repo is a performance bottleneck, please consider moving that code somewhere else - the systems involved in ASH Admin should be human-scale.
